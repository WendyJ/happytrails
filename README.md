By [James Ward](http://jamesward.com "James' Blog") and [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com "Matt's Blog").

Happy Trails is a web application that was written in Play 2 (Java) and Grails 2 in order to do a side-by-side comparison of the two frameworks. The results of this comparison are [scheduled to be presented at UberConf](http://uberconf.com/conference/denver/2012/06/session?id=25584) on June 21, 2012.
